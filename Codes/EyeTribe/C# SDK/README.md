This is the C# reference implementation for the EyeTribe Server. The implementation provides a simple C# interface for communicating with the server through the [TET API](http://dev.theeyetribe.com/api/). This allows developers to easily get started and focus their energy on creating innovative and immersive apps using our eye tracking technology. 

This version is to be considered **_beta_**. Feedback and bug fix submissions are welcome.
