# I-Focus

In our research, we conducted trial tests on 2 platforms - a game and a website - to test out the intuitiveness, feasibility and functionality of eye-tracking on them.

6 participants were randomly selected from the Defence Science Organisation of Singapore, of varying ages, ranging from 28-35 years old. Some participants did not have any experience with eye-tracking and leap motion, but all of them underwent a proper briefing. 
We found out that once the the eye-tracker is accurate enough, eye-tracking beats the mouse in terms of intuitiveness, speed and efficiency, as well as performance for targeting & tracking tasks.

We also found out that the most optimal method of navigating with an eye-tracker is with a radial menu.
Although most prefered physical clicks and scrolling with the mouse wheel, they still found the optimised scrolling method and modified cursor quite intuitive.
